# Design a Business IT Solution

## The Plot

You are going to be the IT guy for a small business.  You need to generate an IT strategy for the business & present it to the boss.

The first iteration of this will be to sketch your initial thoughts.  We will revisit this assignment at the end of the course to give it more polish after learning a variety of topics.

For this exercise, choose a type of business for whom you will be the IT manager and primary support.  For each of these types of businesses, there is a variety of data to consider, in addition to support tools and access scope for different categories of users that will interact with the business.

- dentist
- car dealership
- private school
- museum
- cyber cafe (coffee shop + internet access point)

## The Content

When constructing a plan, we aren't going to be super official about format (yet).  But in general, you should be considering things like:

- Types of people working there
- Types of people interacting with the business services
- Infrastructure (power & networking)
- Types of systems (and purposes)
- Software / service needs

Your plan should use good markdown formatting to make it presentable.
