In YOUR `ceg2410-youGHUsername` repository, create a report named `final.md`.

Your final will be to pair out with classmates and discuss your projects.  This will be done 3-5 times, depending on timing.

You will complete this document by interviewing a classmate about their project.  There are fill in the blanks because I'm not sure what people ended up on.  Replace blanks with names.

This is broken out into categories because it was going to be a BINGO game.  Therefore each category already has options to consider and see if the apply to your classmate's project.

When filling out the document with interviews, `Last name` refers to the last name of the student you are interviewing.
