# Self-Hosted Service Report

This report will be centered around your implementation of self-hosting one of the below services.  This is not a group project - you must implement networking, hosting and management yourself in addition to writing up the companion report.  That said, you may partner with others who picked the same software to host to help with troubleshooting / advice.  As with all work in this course, cite sources - be them classmates, web resources, or generative AI to note what helped during your implementation.

## Choose a Software to Host

As stated in class, I am lazily breaking these up into three general categories.

Self-hosted System Management Applications:
- [Unraid](https://unraid.net/) - operating system for self-hosted servers and network-attached storage
- [TrueNAS](https://www.truenas.com/truenas-community-edition/) - The platform harnesses the power of the legendary ZFS file system to easily scale unified storage with the reliability and performance demanded by virtualization, backup, and many other data-intensive workloads.
- [Proxmox](https://www.proxmox.com/en/products/proxmox-virtual-environment/overview) - complete, open-source server management platform for enterprise virtualization. It tightly integrates the KVM hypervisor and Linux Containers (LXC), software-defined storage and networking functionality, on a single platform. With the integrated web-based user interface you can manage VMs and containers, high availability for clusters, or the integrated disaster recovery tools with ease.
- [Grafana](https://grafana.com/oss/grafana/) - Easily collect, correlate, and visualize data with beautiful dashboards using Grafana â€” the open source data visualization and monitoring solution that drives informed decisions, enhances system performance, and streamlines troubleshooting.
- [Homepage](https://github.com/gethomepage/homepage) - A modern, fully static, fast, secure fully proxied, highly customizable application dashboard

Self-hosted Utility Applications:
- [immich](https://immich.app/) - Self-hosted photo and video management solution
- [mealie.io](https://mealie.io/) - Recipe Management For The Modern Household
- [GitLab](https://about.gitlab.com/install/) - an Open Source code repository and collaborative software development platform
- [ownCloud](https://owncloud.com/download-server/) - real-time content collaboration platform

Self-hosted Game Servers:
> [!WARNING]
> This may get iffy in your AWS Academy account.  Validate that you can build an instance per minimum required specs before proceeding.  I'm not sure AWS Academy accounts can request GPU resources.
> This may also include additional fees to have a software license.

## Host your Software in an EC2 Instance

After making your software selection, your next task is to work on deploying it to an EC2 instance.  
1. Determine a suitable instance type (specs) to run your software
2. Determine which OS is best to install and run your software to
3. Install your software
4. Make network security adjustments appropriate to the needs of your server, your software, and user access
5. Determine an access plan from the following perspectives:
    - server administration
    - users wanting to access the software
6. Demonstrate proper configuration by utilizing features provided by the software
    - Given the scope of allowed software, I am keeping this vague, so here are some examples:
        - Grafana - dashboard a server you manage
        - mealie - prove a user can sign in, save a recipe, and another can view it
        - Minecraft - prove players (with permission) can sign in and play
7. Create a backup policy appropriate to the system / software
    - Things to consider:
        - is there a file or set of files that could be backed up to an S3 bucket?
        - is the software so engrained that a backup needs to be an AMI image? (see Promox)
