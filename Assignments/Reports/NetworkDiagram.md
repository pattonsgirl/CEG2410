## AWS Network Diagram Report

Create a diagram detailing how the AWS instance can be connected to and achieves connectivity with the outside world.

Use lucidchart, excalidraw, canva, or draw.io

Put your diagram, and any supporting descriptive text you would like to add, in your course GitHub repository in a file named `network-diagram-report.md`

Rubric:
- 3 pts = I can use it in a class
- 2 pts = minor misunderstandings, otherwise clean
- 1 pts = missing AWS network elements / major misunderstandings
- 0 pts = shoddy work / major issues
