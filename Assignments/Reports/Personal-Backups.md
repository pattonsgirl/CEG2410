# Personal Backups Report

Individually, make a file in your course repo named `personal-backup.md`.  *Thoughtfully* fill out the below.  Single word answers or answers that provide no thought will get no credit.

1. Describe the type of data that you would value backing up.

2. Give an *approximation* (in size) to your total data backup needs.

3. Describe what you are *currently* doing for backups.

4. Describe your backup *resolution* (plan to implement) to meet 3-2-1 backup "rule" standards.

Submit the link to your report to the Dropbox on Pilot.
