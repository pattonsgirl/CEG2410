# Filesystem Research

Create a research report (named `fs-research.md`) in your GitHub repo.  If you are in class working as a group, only one submission is needed as long as a group member wrote your name on the report.  Submit your report to the Dropbox on Pilot

Picking among:
- ZFS
- BeeFS
- GlusterFS
- MooseFS
- LizardFS
- XTremeFS

Report on:
1. What OS is it compatible with?
2. What is it for?
3. How does it store data? Objects?  Files?
4. How much data can it store? (total data storage, per file / object data storage)
5. Is there something special about ability to use? (hardware, software, side-things needed?)
6. Is there a license?  Free?  Pay?
