You may - and are encouraged to - bring your own site just to make grading more fun. 

Your site must contain a minimum of:
- an `index.html` file
- `.css` file(s) and / or image file(s) referred to by your `.html` file(s)
- a `404.html` page

You may use generative AI to create these, but you must cite the generative AI used and the prompt fed to it.
