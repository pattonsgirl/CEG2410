## Task 6 - S3 HTTP Hosting

Complete the following tutorial to host a **static** website on S3.  You are welcome to look up additional tutorials that have more pictures.

Name your bucket `yourlastname.com`

[Tutorial: Configuring a static website on Amazon S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/HostingWebsiteOnS3Setup.html)

Add your static web content files to the S3 bucket.  There needs to be a minimum of an `index.html`, `404.html`, and referenced content (image file(s) or `css` file(s))

On March 9th, 2024, I left my future self a note - "AWS has a default page. Be specific if you want non-default index.html" So watch out for that.

## Documentation

Create a folder in your course GitHub repository called `Web-Hosting`.  Create a file named `s3-hosting.md` and insert the following details.

- Link to tutorial(s) used to setup or your bucket or assist with troubleshooting
- Test your index.html by visiting the site URL.  Document the URL
- Test the error page by requesting a file / resource that does not exist in your bucket.  Document a URL that will resolve to your `404` page 
- Research and document the AWS recommended way to associate a Domain name with your S3 bucket
- Research and document the AWS recommended way to enable HTTPS
