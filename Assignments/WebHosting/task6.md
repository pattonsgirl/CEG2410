## Task 6 - Hosting in S3

Complete the following tutorial to host a **static** website on S3.  You are welcome to look up additional tutorials that have more pictures.

Name your bucket `yourlastname.com`

Your bucket needs to contain a minimum of:
- an `index.html` (default / home page)
- a `404.html` (error page for unfound resources)

You may use your own content or ask ChatGPT or another generative AI to create content to your theme of choice.

Test your index.html by visiting the site URL.  Test the error page by requesting a file / resource that does not exist in your bucket.

On March 9th, 2024, I left my future self a note - "AWS has a default page. Be specific if you want non-default index.html"
