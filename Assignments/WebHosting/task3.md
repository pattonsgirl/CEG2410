## Task 3 - Permissions Configuration

There is a different between server maintenance and those who need to edit site content, and those who only need to view site content.

## Documentation

Create a folder in your course GitHub repository called `Web-Hosting`.  Create a file named `permissions.md` and insert the following details.

- Document the "username" utilized by the apache service
- Determine and document a permissions structure for server admins and site developers
- Implement the structure and document your implementation steps
- Provide a write up for admins to add a new developer to the site developers
- Configure the site's root document directory to be editable by site developers and readable by the apache service. Document how you configured this and screenshot(s) proving your implementation worked

## Extra credit

You may choose one or both EC objectives

1. Set the site's root document directory permissions to be persistent (auto configured) when new files are added to the site's root document directory. Document how you configured this and screenshot(s) proving your implementation worked
2. Restrict site developers from using a shell session - they may only edit via SFTP. Document how you configured this and screenshot(s) proving your implementation worked

## Submission

Submit a link in Pilot to your course GitHub repository with your permissions documentation.
