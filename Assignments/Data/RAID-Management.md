# RAID Management

in class, we built a RAID 6 array with a Linux software tool - mdadm.  Your task now is to play with some command RAID Management tastings.

1. Describe your RAID setup with supporting screenshots of your AWS EBS volumes attached to the instance and the status of your built RAID managed by mdadm on your AWS instance.

2. How can mdadm (with or without supporting tools) detect RAID degradation?  Respond in terms of the whole RAID and detection of pending failure for a singular disk.

3. Remove a disk or two (EBS volume) used in your RAID array via AWS (not via the instance's command line). Describe the effect of this on your RAID array availability and add supporting screenshots of your AWS EBS volumes and status of your built RAID managed by mdadm.

4.
