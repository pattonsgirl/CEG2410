### Group Policy Objects (GPO):  
Computer-related policies specify:
- system behavior
- application settings
- security settings
- assigned applications
- computer startup and shutdown scripts
User-related policies specify:
- system behavior
- application settings
- security settings
- assigned and published applications
- user logon and logoff scripts
- folder redirection

Be aware that computer-related settings override user-related settings.  

GPO order of policy application:
- LSDOU order: local, site, domain, organization unit (OU). 
1. the policy on the local computer gets processed. 
2. Active Directory policies from the site level to the domain. 
3. Organizational unit: GPOs that are nested within organizational units apply from the closest OU to the root, then continue outwards from there. If any conflicts arise, the last applied policy will take precedence and effect.

    - Is good, sometimes misinterprets what a GPO policy does by definition (just read the descriptions!)
